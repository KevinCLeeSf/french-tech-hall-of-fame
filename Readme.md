French tech talents, the trusted list
=====================================

This is A list of french tech talents, not perfect, but at least it is made by us: developers, devops, sysadmins, people who understand tech, people who know best the french tech people.

This is an open-source "crowd-written" list. It is curated by [#while42](http://while42.org) (The French Tech Engineers Network) members. Anyone who understand tech and know french tech people can complete it by sending a pull-request, because everyone should be able to participate (that's why it is written in English).

Why this list?
--------------

This is our way to answer the publication of the other list, which we think is a great initiative. However, we find it very unfortunate that, once again, people talk about the french tech engineers, without asking french tech engineers, without asking french tech schools and universities, without asking french tech networks, without asking the whole tech eco-system.

And because we think that #lafrenchtech without the french techs, is non-sense.

How-to
------

Please make a pull-request with the french tech engineers you want to add to the submissions.txt list. It has to be someone who is, or was, a dev/devops/ops/sysadmins/... a tech profile and French.

For your pull-request, please add first name + last name + company or product on each line following this model :

- Firstname Lastname (Company, Product, ...)

We will then complete the list, with a short description / bio of the person.
